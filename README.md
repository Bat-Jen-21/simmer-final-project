# Simmer

#### Video Demo: PLACEHOLDER URL

Simmer is a web based application that allows the user to record their own recipes and view others. There is
Search functionality built in to filter recipes by title name or ingredients.

## How It's Made

To make this project I used Python, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Django

## How It Works

### Features

**User authentication and registering**

To handle the user accounts features such as registering, login/out and account deletion I used
djangos inbuilt accounts form and models. I intergrated these into the web app by applying my own custom 
css and using database queries to handle account spesific actions such as recipe deletion (which can only
be done by using the recipe's registered creator account or maually by an admin modifying the database).
